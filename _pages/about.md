# I joined National Institute of Healthcare Data Science at Nanjing University (NJU) in 2020 as the assistant researcher. Prior to NJU, 
I obtained my PhD degree (2020) and Bachelor degree (2014) in engineering from Shandong University under the supervision of Prof. [Yilong Yin](http://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/ylyin/zh_CN/index.htm). I have also studied in Prof. Shuo Li's group at Western University, CA in 2016 as the visiting student. After that, I was supported by China Scholarship Council (CSC) and spent one and half years at University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the supervision of Prof. Vikas Singh. Besides, I pursued an internship at Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI), UAE.

My research interests span both machine learning and computer vision, including meta-learning, flow-based generative model, few-shot learning, medical image analysis, set matching, etc.
